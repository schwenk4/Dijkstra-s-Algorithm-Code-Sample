# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-Code-Sample
The code sample provided generates a maze with enemies spawned in it using Disjoint Sets and BFS traversal. Then, using Dijkstra's Algorithm the program finds the shortest path through the maze.

This was a group project, but the code provided is all mine.

When writing code, I like to make it as modular as possible. Adding helper functions not only serves to make code more legible, but they can also be reuseable for other parts of the code, saving time. Due to the number of functions I prefer to use, I like to give each function a detailed header to help others easily understand what it does. I tend to use a lot of comments to make my code very clear and readable, but I am working on cutting back. I like to make my code commented to the point where it is clear what is happening, but not overly commented to the point where it is annoying to read.
